Alefpress - Open Source Desktop Publishing 
==============================

## About Alefpress
Alefpress is a downstream distribution from scribus.  One of the reasons for that – allow users to distinguish our builds from official ones to avoid confusions. Also, this way of differentiating is a necessary requirement to allow us apply for some development funding programs, which gives us a chance to get an extra funding for scribus development.

This step shouldn’t be considered as “forking” in terms of “schism” (as given by Wikipedia  – “a split in the developer community”). We plan to continue submitting our changes to official scribus repository via pull requests and looking forward for further collaboration.

## Alefpress's Goals
- Better support for non-Latin Languages.
- make Scribus stable & reliable.

## History
We start scribus development in 2015 as HOST-Oman project. We succeed at landing Complex text layout features into Scribus 1.5.3. These features are but not limited to:
- support RTL languages (Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hebrew).
- support Bi-directional text.
- support Indic Scripts and Languages.
- support more than 500 languages.
- support OpenType Font Features.
- allow customization of hyphenation character
- add ability to link selected text frames directly 
- Loading and render long docs are faster.
